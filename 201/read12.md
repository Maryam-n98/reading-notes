Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool.
The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js.

You can copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory youâ€™ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script.
you can do a lot of things like you can but a line, Drawing a bar chart,and Conclusion.

Creating a ChartIt's easy to get started with Chart.js. All that's required is the script included in your page along with a single "<canvas>" node to render the chart.
"At first sight a "<canvas>" looks like the "<img>" element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the "<canvas>" element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

The <canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for <video>, <audio>, or <picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers."

You can drawing shapes with canvas, Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.
Unlike SVG, <canvas> only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes.
Drawing paths: a path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed. 
The first step to create a path is to call the beginPath(). Internally, paths are stored as a list of sub-paths (lines, arcs, etc) which together form a shape. Every time this method is called, the list is reset and we can start drawing new shapes.
"Note: When the current path is empty, such as immediately after calling beginPath(), or on a newly created canvas, the first path construction command is always treated as a moveTo(), regardless of what it actually is. For that reason, you will almost always want to specifically set your starting position after resetting a path."
and after you finish you can Applying styles and colors.
like: "fillStyle = color" Sets the style used when filling shapes.
"strokeStyle = color" Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
"Note: When you set the strokeStyle and/or fillStyle property, the new value becomes the default for all shapes being drawn from then on. For every shape you want in a different color, you will need to reassign the fillStyle or strokeStyle property."
The lineCap property determines how the end points of every line are drawn. There are three possible values for this property and those are: butt, round and square. By default this property is set to butt.
butt: The ends of lines are squared off at the endpoints.
round: The ends of lines are rounded.
square:The ends of lines are squared off by adding a box with an equal width and half the height of the line's thickness.
The lineJoin property determines how two connecting segments (of lines, arcs or curves) with non-zero lengths in a shape are joined together (degenerate segments with zero lengths, whose specified endpoints and control points are exactly at the same position, are skipped).

There are three possible values for this property: round, bevel and miter. By default this property is set to miter. Note that the lineJoin setting has no effect if the two connected segments have the same direction, because no joining area will be added in this case.
round: Rounds off the corners of a shape by filling an additional sector of disc centered at the common endpoint of connected segments. The radius for these rounded corners is equal to half the line width.
bevel: Fills an additional triangular area between the common endpoint of connected segments, and the separate outside rectangular corners of each segment.
miter: Connected segments are joined by extending their outside edges to connect at a single point, with the effect of filling an additional lozenge-shaped area. This setting is effected by the miterLimit property which is explained below.

The text is filled using the current fillStyle.
The text is filled using the current strokeStyle.
font = value
The current text style being used when drawing text. This string uses the same syntax as the CSS font property. The default font is 10px sans-serif.
textAlign = value
Text alignment setting. Possible values: start, end, left, right or center. The default value is start.
textBaseline = value
Baseline alignment setting. Possible values: top, hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic, bottom. The default value is alphabetic.
direction = value
Directionality. Possible values: ltr, rtl, inherit. The default value is inherit.
These properties might be familiar to you, if you have worked with CSS before.0\
In Gecko (the rendering engine of Firefox, Firefox OS and other Mozilla based applications), some prefixed APIs were implemented in earlier versions to draw text on a canvas. These are now deprecated and removed, and are no longer guaranteed to work.

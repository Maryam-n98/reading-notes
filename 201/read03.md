In HTML we have three type of the list:

To make Ordered lists you should use element "<ol>", each item in list put between "<li>" and "</li>", and its use numbers.
To make Unordered lists use element "<ul>", and its have to put item in "<li>", its use bullets.
And to make Definition lists use element "<dl>" and its difereent it have to put it between "<dt>" or "<dd>" elements, and it's use  to define terminology.
"You can put a second list inside an "<li>" element to create a sublist or nested list."

## From the Duckett JS book:

### Chapter 2:
"A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe. "
ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:
In java you can use some opetators : to ADDITION use +, to SUBTRACTION -, toDIVISION use /, to MULTIPLICATION use *, to INCREMENT use ++, to DECREMENT use --, and finally to MODULUS use %.
you can use boolean (true and false).
"Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value."
### Chapter 4:
In java you can too use statment like if else statment and swich statment.
"Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands."
"A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value."
Loop its use when you need to reapet a statment more than one time.
this is three type for loop : for loop , while loop, and do while loop.

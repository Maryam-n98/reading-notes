### From (https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/):
How does pair programming work? the Driver and the Navigator.
What the difference between them?
The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
"There are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language: Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful."
Its 6 Reasons for Pair Programming:
1. Greater efficiency: It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient.if there more one people work in the code they can find the mistakes faster than only one work in the code.
Researches also identified pairing enhances technical skills, team communication, and even enjoyability of coding in the workplace.
2. Engaged collaboration: When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. Popping open your Facebook timeline is just that less enticing when someone else is looking at your screen.
3.Learning from fellow students: 
when you have a problem we should ask to help over 15 minuets.
4.  Social skills: This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities.
5. Job interview readiness: For most roles, the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.
6. Work environment readiness:
Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.

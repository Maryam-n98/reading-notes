### Chapter 19: Practical Information:

###### Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
"Search engine: optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.
On-page techniques: are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines.
Off-Page Techniques: Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours."
In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability:
1.Page Title.
2.URL / Web Address.
3.Headings.
4.Text.
5. Link Text.
6.: Image Alt Text.
7.Page Descriptions.
There are six steps that will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site:
1-Brainstorm: List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is about.
2-Organize: Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.
3-Research: There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider, such as:adwords.google.co.uk/select/KeywordToolExternal (When using this tool, select the "exact match" option rather than "broad match.")www.wordtracker.com
www.keyworddiscovery.com.
4-Compare: It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every keyword. This is especially true for topics where there is a lot of competition. The more sites out there that have already been optimized for a given keyword, the harder it will be for you to rise up the search results when people search on that term.
5-Refine: Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on, These should always be the ones that are most relevant to each section of your site.
6-Map: Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which have the most competition, and which ones are most relevant, it is time to start picking which keywords you will use for each page.
 Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.
 Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).

### Chapter 3:
You can pul a lot of value for a lot of variables in Java Script.
You can put an object then you can put a name for property and make a value for it.
And you can put function inside the object.
A METHOD OF AN OBJECT: When a function is defined inside an object, it becomes a method. In a method, this refers to the containing object. 
FUNCTION EXPRESSION AS METHOD: If a named function has been defined in global scope, and it is then used as a method of an object, this refers to the object it is contained within.
### Chapter 5: “Document Object Model”
THE DOM TREE IS A MODEL OF A WEB PAGE "As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes. "
The terms elements and element nodes are used interchangeably but when people say the DOM is working with an element, it is actually working with a node that represents that element. 
Array syantax: you can access indivdual nodes using [] square brackets syntax similar to that used to access indiviual items from an array.
The "lenght" property indicatees how many elements are in the value (the number of elements dictates how many times loop should run).
And you will menshin how time it run when you [] and put the variable inside it.
"innerHTML: When getting HTML from an element, the i nnerHTML property will get the content of an element and return it as one long string, including any markup that the element contains. When used to set new content for an element, it will take a string that can contain markup and process that string, adding any elements within it to the DOM tree. "
element.innerHTML The i nnerHTML property lets you get/update the entire content of any element (including markup) as a string.

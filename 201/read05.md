# Read 05 Readings : Images, Color, Text

## From the Duckett HTML book:
### Chaptre 5: Images
You can put an image on your web page that will make it look more beautiful and the image can express a lot of things.
You can make a folder to put all images you want to use it in your website.
“<img>” you should use this element to put your images and it will have(src) to write the images where you can the photo file, or to put photo URL link.
(alt) This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it, and you can write width and height to specific the height and width in px
And you can use align to align photo to left or right on your page, and you can skip it and do the same in CSS.
And in align too you can use “top: This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image.
 Middle: This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.
 Bottom: This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.”
  
### Chapter 11: Color
You can set the color in CSS in three ways:
1. rgb values 2. Hex code 3. Name color.
Rgb value: Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255, 
Example: “rgb(102,205,170) This color is made up of the following values: 102 red 205 green 170 blue”.
Hex Codes: Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code,
Example: “#66cdaa The value of the red, 102, is expressed as 66 in hexadecimal code. The 205 of the green is expressed as cd and the 170 of the blue equates to aa.”
Color Names: Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number,
Example: “MediumAquaMarine There are 147 color names supported by browsers (this color is MediumAquaMarine). Most consider this to be a limited color palette, and it is hard to remember the name for each of the colors so (apart from white and black) they are not commonly used.”
HSL Colors: 
Hue: is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be shown as a slider with values from 0 to 360.
Saturation: is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.
Lightness: is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.
alpha This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75 represents 75% transparency.

### Chapter 12: Text
This is more one style and more than width and structure to the text, like we have some text bold, italic, black, regular, normal, light, medium, ect….
The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.
And you can choose the size for your text by font size, and you can put it in px or in percentage or em.
 An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m.
And when you use element font-weight you can make the text bold, normal, italic, etc..
And when you use element text-decoration you can make the text underline, overline, none, etc..
The text-align property allows you to control the alignment of text. The property can take one of four values: you can move the text to the left, right, center or justified.

## From Blog Post
There are hundreds of image formats available each with a specific use case.
Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in color and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations.
JPEG is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception.

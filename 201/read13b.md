## CSS

### Transforms:
The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.
Transform Syntax
The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.
***2D Transforms***
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. 
2D Rotate
The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically.
In html file we should use element figure, and in css file we use element transform.
***3D Transforms***
"Working with two-dimensional transforms we are able to alter elements on the horizontal and vertical axes, however there is another axis along which we can transform elements. Using three-dimensional transforms we can change elements on the z axis, giving us control of depth as well as length and width.

3D Rotate
So far we’ve discussed how to rotate an object either clockwise or counterclockwise on a flat plane. With three-dimensional transforms we can rotate an element around any axes. To do so, we use three new transform values, including rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.

Using the rotateX value allows you to rotate an element around the x axis, as if it were being bent in half horizontally. Using the rotateY value allows you to rotate an element around the y axis, as if it were being bent in half vertically. Lastly, using the rotateZ value allows an element to be rotated around the z axis.

As with the general rotate value before, positive values will rotate the element around its dedicated axis clockwise, while negative values will rotate the element counterclockwise."

and here we have 3 in html and 3 element in css.
and we have a lot of things we can do it inside this.
"
CSS3 has introduced countless possibilities for UX designers, and the best thing about them is that the coolest parts are really simple to implement.

Just a couple of lines of code will give you an awesome transition effect that will excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions. What’s more, these effects are hardware accelerated, and a progressive enhancement that you can use right now."
we have Here are 8 really simple effects that will add life to your UI and smiles to your users’ faces.

1. Fade in
Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.
Fade in effects are coded in two steps: first, you set the initial state; next, you set the change, for example on hover.
we should use this code in css 
.fade
{
        opacity:0.5;
}
.fade:hover
{
        opacity:1;
}

2. Change color
Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them. Now, we just set the div’s class to “color” and specify the color 
we want use it in our CSS:

.color:hover
{
        background:#53a7ea;
}
and when put mause in it it will be blue you can use any color you want.
3. Grow & Shrink
To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge.
and we have it code in css:
but firt we should have a class:
.our-class:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: scale(1.3);
        -ms-transform: scale(1.3);
        transform: scale(1.3);
}
when we put the mause it will be bagger.
Shrinking an element is as simple as growing it. To enlarge an element we specify a value greater than 1, to shrink it, we specify a value less than 1 like:
.shrink:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: scale(0.8);
        -ms-transform: scale(0.8);
        transform: scale(0.8);
}
and here when we put the mause it will be smaller.
4. Rotate elements
CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element. Give your div the class “rotate” and add the following to your CSS:
and use this code:
.rotate:hover
{
        -webkit-transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
        -ms-transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
        transform: rotateZ(-30deg);
}
when we put the mause it will be rotate.
5. Square to circle
A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa. With CSS, it’s a simple effect to achieve, we just transition the border-radius property.

Give your div the class “circle” and add this CSS to your styles:
and use this code:
.circle:hover
{
        border-radius:50%;
}
when we put the mause it will be change to circle.
6. 3D shadow
3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces.

This effect is achieved by adding a box shadow, and then moving the element on the x axis using the transform and translate properties so that it appears to grow out of the screen.

Give your div the class “threed” and then add the following code to your CSS:

.threed:hover
{
        box-shadow:
                1px 1px #53a7ea,
                2px 2px #53a7ea,
                3px 3px #53a7ea;
        -webkit-transform: translateX(-3px);
        transform: translateX(-3px);
}
when we put the mause it will be change to 3D effect.

7. Swing
Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.

In this case, we’ll first define a CSS animation in your styles. You’ll notice that due to implementation issues, we need to use @-webkit-keyframes as well as @keyframes (yes, Internet Explorer really is better than Chrome, in this respect at least).
and here we should put this code in css:
@-webkit-keyframes swing
{
    15%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(5px);
        transform: translateX(5px);
    }
    30%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(-5px);
       transform: translateX(-5px);
    } 
    50%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(3px);
        transform: translateX(3px);
    }
    65%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(-3px);
        transform: translateX(-3px);
    }
    80%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(2px);
        transform: translateX(2px);
    }
    100%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(0);
        transform: translateX(0);
    }
}
@keyframes swing
{
    15%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(5px);
        transform: translateX(5px);
    }
    30%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(-5px);
        transform: translateX(-5px);
    }
    50%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(3px);
        transform: translateX(3px);
    }
    65%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(-3px);
        transform: translateX(-3px);
    }
    80%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(2px);
        transform: translateX(2px);
    }
    100%
    {
        -webkit-transform: translateX(0);
        transform: translateX(0);
    }
}
This animation simply moves the element left and right, now all we need to do is apply it:

.swing:hover
{
        -webkit-animation: swing 1s ease;
        animation: swing 1s ease;
        -webkit-animation-iteration-count: 1;
        animation-iteration-count: 1;
}
8. Inset border
One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border. We can of course add a border to an element simply, but that will change the element’s position. We could fix that problem using box sizing, but a far simpler solution is the transition in a border using an inset box shadow.

Give your div the class “border” and add the following CSS to your styles:
Then use this code:
.border:hover
{
        box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 25px #53a7ea;
}
To get floating squares, in other words, it will be up and then down in a certain way.
you should write this code in HTML file
<'div class="group">
		<'button class="blam">Blam</button>
		<'button style="-webkit-animation-delay: .3s;animation-delay: .3s;" class="syke">Syke</button>
		<'button style="-webkit-animation-delay: .6s;animation-delay: .6s;" class="later">Later</button>
	<'/div>
    and then use it in css:
    @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Sans:700);
		*{
			margin: 0;
			padding: 0;
			box-sizing: border-box;
			transition: all .1s;
		}
		body{
		background-color: #424242;
			font-family: 'Droid Sans', sans-serif;
		}
		.group{
			text-align: center;
			margin: 20px auto;
		}
		.group button{
			margin-top: 10px;
		}
		button{
/*			box-sizing: border-box;*/
			background: NONE;
			border: none;
			outline: none;
			border-radius: 3px;
			padding: 15px 70px;
			color:white;
			text-transform: uppercase;
			font-weight: 700;
			text-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.41);
			box-shadow: 0 3px 0 0 #383838;
			border:3px solid transparent;
			
		
			animation: pulse 1s linear infinite alternate;
			-webkit-animation: pulse 1s linear infinite alternate;
		}
		.active,
		button:active{
			background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0,0,0,.1) 13%, transparent 13%,transparent);
			box-shadow: 0 1px 0 0 #383838;
			color: rgba(0, 0, 0,.45);
			text-shadow: none;
			
			
			-webkit-animation-play-state: paused; 
    	animation-play-state: paused;
		}
		button:focus,
		button:hover{
			-webkit-animation-play-state: paused; 
    	animation-play-state: paused;
		}
		
		
		.blam:focus,
		.blam:hover{
			background-color:#0097bd;
		}
		.blam{
			background-color:#00bff0;
			border-color: #00bff0;
		}
		
		.syke:focus,
		.syke:hover{
			background-color:#ad4e4e;
		}
		.syke{
			background-color:#e06464;
			border-color:#e06464;
		}
		
		.later:focus,
		.later:hover{
			background-color:#7c8b8f;
		}
		.later{
			background-color:#a8bdc2;
			border-color:#a8bdc2;
		}
		
		@-webkit-keyframes pulse {
			100% {
				transform: translateY(6.9px); 
			} 
		}

		@keyframes pulse {
			100% {
				transform: translateY(6.9px); 
			} 
		}
        you can change the button name and what you want in this code.

        and you can have a nice animation for your number you can but your number in h1 or any h elements then use this code in css:
        body {
  margin:0;
  font-family:sans-serif;
  color:#f25252;
  background:#f7f7f7;
}
h1 {
  font-size:11rem;
  position:absolute;
  transform:translate(-50%,-50%);
  margin:0;
}
h1:nth-of-type(1){
  animation: range 4s infinite;
}
h1:nth-of-type(2){
  left:50%;
  top:50%;
  animation: size 4s infinite;
}
h1:nth-of-type(3){
  animation: range2 4s infinite;
}
@keyframes range {
  0%  {left:42%;top:50%;font-size:11rem;}
  25% {left:50%;top:40%;font-size:4.5rem;}
  50% {left:58%;top:50%;font-size:11rem;}
  75% {left:50%;top:60%;font-size:4.5rem;}
  100%{left:42%;top:50%;font-size:11rem;}
}
@keyframes range2 {
  0%  {left:58%;top:50%;font-size:11rem;}
  25% {left:50%;top:60%;font-size:4.5rem;}
  50% {left:42%;top:50%;font-size:11rem;}
  75% {left:50%;top:40%;font-size:4.5rem;}
  100%{left:58%;top:50%;font-size:11rem;}
}
@keyframes size {
  0%  {font-size:11rem;}
  25% {font-size:26rem;}
  50% {font-size:11rem;}
  75% {font-size:26rem;}
  100%{font-size:11rem;}
}
insid the body select your favorite font and color and what you want.

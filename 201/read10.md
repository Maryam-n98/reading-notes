THE STACK The JavaScript interpreter processes one line of code at a time. When a statement needs data from another function, it stacks (or piles) the new function on top of the current task. When a statement has to call some other code in order to do its job, the new task goes to the top of the pile of things to do.

###### And there is many type of error and each type mention to something different, like Syntax Error, Eval error, Rang Error itâ€™s mean an error in the number, undefined we see it a lot it mean you used a variable and its not defined, ect...

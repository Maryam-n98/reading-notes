# Read 08 CSS Layout:
## From the Duckett HTML book:
### Chapter 15 Layout:
Block-Level Elements :
To start on a new line use Elements '<h1>' '<p>' '<ul>' '<li>'.
Inline Elements flow in between surrounding text use elements '<img>' '<b>' '<i>'.

"Containing Elements: If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element."
CSS has a lot of position types: normal flow, ralative position, Absolute positioning, Fixed Positioning, Floating Elements.
"In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be:position: static;"
Position static: It's move the element out side this box, it will be out his element place, it's mean you can move it where you want in the screen.
Position relative: It's referance to relative to it self.
The element still in his place but move inside the place.
position abslute: it will not go out from inside the box, but it will move.
position fixed:it will be in the screen and it will scroll up and down with screen, it mean its will be in the screen always when you in the website.
position stucty: the element will be in the screen when you only scroll down, it's mean when you scroll up it dosn't up with your screen.


" '<div>' elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page."
"Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning."

!= it to see if they are not the same of the vale.
!== its check that both of value and data type are not the same.
>  its checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
< its checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
 >= its checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right.
<= its checks if the number on the left is less than or equal the number on the right.
* logical operators:
&& Logical and: if both expressions evaluate to true then the expression returns true. If just one of this returns false, then the expression will return false.
 Logical or : if one of expression evaluate to true, then the expression returns true. And if both of them is false, then the expression will return false.
! Logical not: true returns false, false return true.
Loops: there are three common types of loops:
For  :’ its most common loop’, it use if you need to run code a specific number of times.
While: it use if you don’t know how many times the code should run.
Do While: its very similar to the while loop, but it has one key difference.

## Java OO Tutorial 
Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods.
###### What Is an Object?
Objects have states and behaviors. 
A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.

###### What Is a Class?
A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.
#### Declaring Classes
The public class name should be the name of the source file as well which should be appended by .java at the end. 
If the class is defined inside a package, then the package statement should be the first statement in the source file.


##### There are several kinds of variables:

Member variables in a class—these are called fields.
Variables in a method or block of code—these are called local variables.
Variables in method declarations—these are called parameters.

All variables must have a type.

You cannot declare more than one method with the same name and the same number and type of arguments, because the compiler cannot tell them apart.

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

A Decimal Number (based on the number 10) contains a Decimal Point.
The decimal point goes between Ones and Tenths.
Every digit in a decimal number has a "position":
Every position further to the left is 10 times bigger, and every position further to the right is 10 times smaller.

Binary Numbers: are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits.

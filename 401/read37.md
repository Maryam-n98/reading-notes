# Read: 37 - S3
#### Amazon S3 is an online storage that designed to make web-scale computing easier.

* There is container for stored objects in Amazon S3 that is called Bucket.

* Entities stored in Amazon S3 are objects.

* Every bucket has an object with a unique identifier that is called key

* Amazon S3 data consistency model: Amazon S3 provides strong read-after-write consistency for PUTs and DELETEs of objects in your Amazon S3 bucket in all AWS Regions.

#### Benefits of Amazon S3:

- Create a bucket – Create and name your own bucket in which to store your objects.
- Write an object – Store data by creating or overwriting an object. When you write an object, you specify a unique key in the namespace of your bucket. This is also a good time to specify any access control you want on the object.
- Read an object – Read data back. You can download the data via HTTP.
- Delete an object – Delete some of your data.
- List keys – List the keys contained in one of your buckets. You can filter the key list based on a prefix.
###### We use Amazon S3 because it has a simple web services interface. Also, it gives the access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.

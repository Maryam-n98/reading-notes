# Read: 06 - Inheritance and Interfaces

### What Is an Object?

An object has two characteristics:
State: represents the data (value) of an object.
Behaviour: represents the behaviour (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdrawal, etc.
The object is an instance of a class.


### What Is a Class?

A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity.

A class in Java can contain:
Fields
Methods
Constructors
Nested class and interface

### What Is Inheritance?

Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

### What Is an Interface?

interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body.
Implementing an Interface
To declare a class that implements an interface, you include an implements clause in the class declaration. Your class can implement more than one interface, so the implements keyword is followed by a comma-separated list of the interfaces implemented by the class. By convention, the implements clause follows the extends clause, if there is one.

### What Is a Package?

A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages.

Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package.
Advantage of Java Package
1) Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained.
2) Java package provides access protection.
3) Java package removes naming collision.

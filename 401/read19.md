# Spring and Sockets

##### Every project that you need to use spring, you have to do the following:
1. Spring Initializr

2. Add Dependencies
3. Build Your Project
* You can connect the server with JSON file 
* You can create a Message-handling Controller
* You can configure Spring to enable WebSocket and STOMP messaging
* The client will send messages to and receive messages from the server side
* HTML file can import the SockJS and STOMP javascript libraries that will be used to communicate with our server through STOMP over websocket.
* The connect() function uses SockJS and stomp.js to open a connection to /gs-guide-websocket, which is where our SockJS server waits for connections.

## Amazon Kinesis
Amazon Kinesis makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information.


### Benefits:

* Real-time
Amazon Kinesis enables you to ingest, buffer, and process streaming data in real-time, so you can derive insights in seconds or minutes instead of hours or days.
* Fully managed
 Amazon Kinesis is fully managed and runs your streaming applications without requiring you to manage any infrastructure.
* Scalable
 Amazon Kinesis can handle any amount of streaming data and process data from hundreds of thousands of sources with very low latencies.

### Use cases:

* Build video analytics applications
 You can use Amazon Kinesis to securely stream video from camera-equipped devices in homes, offices, factories, and public places to AWS. You can then use these video streams for video playback, security monitoring, face detection, machine learning, and other analytics.
* Evolve from batch to real-time analytics
 With Amazon Kinesis, you can perform real-time analytics on data that has been traditionally analyzed using batch processing. Common streaming use cases include sharing data between different applications, streaming extract-transform-load, and real-time analytics. For example, you can use Kinesis Data Firehose to continuously load streaming data into your S3 data lake or analytics services. 
* Build real-time applications
 You can use Amazon Kinesis for real-time applications such as application monitoring, fraud detection, and live leader-boards. You can ingest streaming data using Kinesis Data Streams, process it using Kinesis Data Analytics, and emit the results to any data store or application using Kinesis Data Streams with millisecond end-to-end latency. This can help you learn about what your customers, applications, and products are doing right now and react promptly.
* Analyze IoT device data
 You can use Amazon Kinesis to process streaming data from IoT devices such as consumer appliances, embedded sensors, and TV set-top boxes. You can then use the data to send real-time alerts or take other actions programmatically when a sensor exceeds certain operating thresholds. Use our sample IoT analytics code to build your application. No need to start from scratch.

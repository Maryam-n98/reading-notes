If you want to choose a text editor, you should look to nice series like can write code, find the mistake, allow you change color text or background, A text editor that has a great selection

of extension will ensure that you could add functionality

as you need it.

We have already a text editor in our device, but we shall make sure if it had what we need like: we can code a web in it or it has find my mistake.

We had another option, we can install some of text editor and the most of there are free from website.

Like:

1.NotePad++ is a free text editor for Windows Computers only, and its own chat room for questions that may arise.

2.BB Edit is software that you purchase. But BB Edit comes with a 30-day free trial. After the 30 days.

Visual Studio Code is a free text editor made by the folks at Microsoft. It is available for Windows computers, Mac computers and Linux computers. VS Code has the Emmet shorthand for HTML and CSS already built-in with no additional work from you at all.
The Difference Between Text Editors and IDEs: An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

 

 

Linux has a graphical user interface, and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX, This tutorial will focus instead on the command line (also known as a terminal) running Bash, it able you to enter commands by typing, and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

All of command must be have a space between them, If you use device on Mac or Linux you have already the terminal but if you use in Windows you can download it free.

Linux is full of shortcuts.

Basic Navigation:

The first command: pwd which stands for Print Working Directory, tell you current path.

Ls: It's short for list, it will you know what in your current location directory, and it have a lot of forms.

(A path is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.)

Relative path: A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

Absolute path: A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

cd which stands for change directory, go inside directory, If you run the command cd without any arguments then it will always take you back to your home directory.

you may hit the Tab key on your keyboard at any time which will invoke an auto complete action.

/etc - Store’s config files for the system.

/var/log - Store’s log files for various system programs.

/bin - The location of several commonly used programs

/usr/bin - Another location for programs on the system.

 

 

 

Everything is file like: my keyboard is file, the system read is file, etc…

Linux is an Extensionless System, not as Windows or other system, it would be more accurate to say that a path is a means to get to a particular location in the system and that location is a file.

And in Linux it is possible to have two or more files and directories with the same name but letters of different case.

Anything inside quotes is considered a single item.

backslash ( \ ): is escape (or nullify).

If the file or directory's name begins with a . (full stop) then it is considered to be hidden, The command ls which we have seen in the previous section will not list hidden files and directories, We may modify it by including the command line option -a so that it does show hidden files and directories.

Linux is case sensitive Beware of silly typos.

Linux is an extensionless system, files can have any extension they like or none at all.
